== Send data to Arduino Nano using "Bluetooth BLE CC41-A"

The Bluetooth device is a "special" HM-10 BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) device,
developed by Bolutek under the name CC41-A.

== Test the Bluetooth (BT) device (AT mode)

=== Configure the BT device with an USB Serial converter

I connected the BT device via an USB to serial converter (CP2102 breakoutboard)
to the PC.

.Connections
[width="30%",,options="header,footer"]
|=====
|BT    |CP2102
|VCC   |VCC
|GND   |GND
|RX    |TX
|TX    |RX
|EN    |
|STATE |
|=====

IMPORTANT: First make the connections and then plug in the USB converter into
the USB port!

.Use HTerm to connect
COM settings: baud rate 9600, data 8, stop 1, parity none +
Also check that after the string automatically a newline character
will be sent.

To check that the connection is ok type *AT* and press ENTER.
The response should be:

 OK

To change the device name to UALI send *AT+NAMEUALI* (with no space between the
command and the new name).


To check all available commands send *AT+HELP*

 OK

== Connect to the BT device from Android

IMPORTANT: Not all Bluetooth applications support connections to BLE devices!!!

I tried several Bluetooth applications until I managed to connect and exchange
data with the BT device.

With the applications that do not support connections to BLE devices one can see
the device while scanning but then the connection fails or it s reported rejected!

TIP: Find out *exactly* which BT device you have and then google for examples!

I personally used
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manishtaraiya.bleterm[BleTerm]


IMPORTANT: In order to be able to send and receive data one must choose the
proper *Service* and *Chaacteristic* ID.

Touch and hold the *Write* and *Read* buttons to select the proper IDs:

image::images\communication-4e604.png["Select IDs",width=128,link="images\communication-4e604.png"]

In order to find out the IDs for your device, you have to send the *AT+UUID* and
*AT+CHAR* commands. See <<Test the Bluetooth (BT) device (AT mode)>>

In my case

 * *AT+UUID* command returned [green]#ffe0#
 * *AT+CHAR* command returned [green]#ffe1#

From the
https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/service-discovery[BLE documentation]
one can get the Base Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)

[grid="rows",format="csv"]
[options="header"]
|===========================
UUID Name, 	UUID
BASE_UUID, 	00000000-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
|===========================


Using the UUID and CHAR codes received from the BLE device and the base 128-bit
UUID one can construct the service and characteristic codes:

* 0000ffe0-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
* 0000ffe1-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
